# Puzzle Blitz

Puzzle Blitz: Red to Green Challenge is an engaging multiplayer game within FruitSalad's learning app that encourages teamwork, quick decision-making, and collaborative problem-solving. In this game, multiple players can enter and split into teams, each assigned to a room with several "red" puzzles. The goal is to solve these puzzles, turning them "green" temporarily. However, the puzzles will gradually turn "red" again, adding an element of urgency. The team wins when they successfully turn all the puzzles "green."

# Minefield Maze

The Minefield Maze Challenge is an exhilarating team-based game within FruitSalad's learning app, designed to test communication, teamwork, and navigation skills. In this game, players form teams of four and find themselves at one end of a large grid-based maze filled with hidden "mines." The objective is to guide each team member through the maze, avoiding mines, and reaching the end. Teams compete to achieve the lowest (best) completion time.

**How to Play:**

1. **Team Formation:**
   * Players gather in groups of four to form teams, ensuring each team has the same number of participants.
2. **Maze Introduction:**
   * Teams are introduced to a large grid-based maze with a designated starting point and an endpoint at the opposite end. Every member has their own course, but they are exactly the same.
3. **Countdown and Start:**
   * A countdown timer begins when all team members are ready.
   * Players can hear each other and communicate throughout the game.
4. **Navigating the Maze:**
   * Teams must navigate through the maze, all at once.
   * The grid contains hidden "mines" that can cause players to return to the starting point if stepped on.
   * Players must work together to identify safe paths and avoid mines.
5. **Guiding Teammates:**
   * Once a player reaches the endpoint, they must guide the remaining team members to reach the endpoint as well.
   * Communication is crucial for safely guiding teammates through the maze.
6. **Completion Time:**
   * The team's completion time is recorded when the last member reaches the endpoint.
   * Teams aim to achieve the lowest (best) completion time possible.
7. **Winner Declaration:**
   * The team with the lowest completion time wins the Minefield Maze Challenge.

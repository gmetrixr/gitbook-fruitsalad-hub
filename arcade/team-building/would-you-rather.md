# Would you rather

Get to know your friends, family, or coworkers in a whole new light with "Would You Rather?". This fun and thought-provoking game challenges you to make difficult (and often hilarious) choices. How it works:

1. **The Question:** A "Would You Rather?" question is presented, offering two often outlandish scenarios.
2. **Your Choice:** Ponder the options and select the one you'd rather experience (even if both sound terrible!).
3. **See the Results:** Discover how others answered the same question. Get ready to compare answers, laugh, and maybe be a little surprised at your friends' choices!

**Key Features**

* **Icebreaker Fun:** Liven up any gathering with a round of "Would You Rather?". It's a great way to spark conversation and learn new things about people.
* **Diverse Questions:** Explore a wide range of questions from silly to serious, covering everything from food preferences to hypothetical life scenarios.
* **Community Results:** The real fun is comparing your answers! See how your choices stack up against the rest of the group.

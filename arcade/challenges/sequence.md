# Sequence

The "Sequence" game in the FruitSalad platform is designed to enhance logical thinking and sequential reasoning skills. In this game, players arrange items or events in a logical or chronological order. This encourages understanding of processes, timelines, and the relationships between different elements. It's particularly beneficial for subjects requiring an understanding of sequences, like history, science, or programming.

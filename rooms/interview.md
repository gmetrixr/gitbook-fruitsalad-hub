# Interview

The "Interview" room is an innovative space designed for conducting interviews with a twist. Here, candidates can be assessed not only through traditional questioning but also by engaging in specially designed games. These games are crafted to evaluate skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and adaptability in a more interactive and revealing manner. For example, a puzzle game might assess logical thinking, while a strategy game could reveal decision-making skills. This approach provides a deeper insight into the candidate's abilities and fit for the role, making the interview process more comprehensive and engaging.

This is a collaborative space, allowing multiple interviewers and observers to join in real-time. This setup fosters a team-based evaluation process, where different perspectives can be shared and discussed seamlessly. The collaborative nature of the room also allows for dynamic interaction with the candidate, providing a more holistic view of their interpersonal and communication skills in a group setting. This enhances the decision-making process, ensuring a well-rounded assessment of each candidate's potential.

# Ski-Slope Meeting

The virtual Ski-Slope Meeting Room is an innovative concept inspired by our [Ski Slope Theory](../research/the-ski-slope-theory/). This theory posits that the environment of a meeting can significantly impact the depth and nature of discussions. In this virtual room, attendees experience a digital ski slope, complete with a ski lift with various time-scales for casual conversations and a dynamic descent that encourages camaraderie and stimulates engaging conversations, emulating the varied experiences of a real ski trip. The room's design incorporates varying slope durations to suit different meeting needs and introduces friendly competition elements, adding an exciting dimension to the virtual meeting experience. This unique approach transforms traditional meetings into more lively and productive interactions.

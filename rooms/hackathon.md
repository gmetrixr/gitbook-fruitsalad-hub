# Hackathon

The Hackathon Room is a virtual ecosystem meticulously designed for hosting hackathons remotely. It encompasses a variety of spaces:

* **Reception Area**: A welcoming space for participants to gather, network, and receive information about the event.
* **Team Discussion Spaces**: Equipped with interactive whiteboards and collaborative tools, these areas allow teams to brainstorm, code, and develop their projects in real time.
* **Presentation Rooms**: Specially designed for teams to showcase their projects, equipped with multimedia capabilities for effective demonstrations.
* **Group Discussion Halls**: Larger areas suitable for workshops, seminars, or general discussions among all participants.
* **Judges' Lounge**: A private, quiet space for judges to deliberate and evaluate submissions, away from the hustle of the main event.
* **Networking Zones**: Informal areas designed to encourage interaction and networking among participants, mentors, and judges.

This virtual venue replicates the dynamic and collaborative environment of a physical hackathon, ensuring an engaging and productive experience for all participants.

# FS Notes Bank

### Contribute to the FruitSalad Notes Bank (Opt-in Feature)

FS is committed to making knowledge **free and accessible to all**. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn and grow from the collective wisdom of others. To further this mission, we offer an **opt-in feature** that allows users to contribute their insights and annotations to the **FS Notes Bank**.

#### How it Works

When you upload your learning objectives to FS and choose the **Contribute to Notes Bank** option, your **anonymized notes and annotations** will be added to a shared repository. This allows other users exploring similar topics to benefit from your insights and gain a deeper understanding of the content.

**Important Note:** Only **anonymized** notes and annotations are added to the Notes Bank. Your personal information and any other identifying details are **never** stored or shared.

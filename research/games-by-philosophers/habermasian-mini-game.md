## Bonus Scenario: **Resolving a Workplace Dilemma through Discourse and Deliberation**

**Step 1: Introduction**

* The mini-game begins with an introduction to a fictional workplace scenario: a company facing a significant ethical dilemma related to a new product launch.

* Each team represents a stakeholder group with varying interests, such as environmental concerns, financial stability, and job security.

**Step 3: Information Gathering**

* Players are provided with a wealth of information, including reports, expert opinions, and data related to the ethical dilemma.
* Teams must collaboratively review and analyze this information to gain a comprehensive understanding of the issue.

**Step 4: Structured Discussions**

* Teams engage in structured, rule-governed discussions within the virtual environment.
* Discussions are guided by principles of communicative action, emphasizing rational discourse, mutual understanding, and the presentation of validity claims.
* Each team member takes turns presenting their perspectives and arguments while actively listening to others.

**Step 5: Negotiation and Consensus**

* As discussions progress, players are encouraged to negotiate and seek common ground.
* The game incorporates decision points where teams must collectively decide on a course of action regarding the product launch.
* Teams can choose to continue deliberating until a consensus is reached, reflecting the importance of open dialogue in decision-making.

**Step 6: Ethical Reflection**

* Following the decision, the game prompts teams to reflect on the ethical implications of their choices.

# The Ski Slope Theory

\
Virtual meetings have become an integral part of our professional lives, especially in a world where remote work and digital communication have gained prominence. While they offer efficiency and convenience, they often lack the human dimension that physical interactions provide. In this discourse, we shall explore the philosophical concept known as "The Ski Slope Theory" to understand how it can enrich the experience of virtual meetings, rekindling the human connection and fostering more engaging interactions.

#### The Human Dimension in Meetings

Restaurants have long served as the backdrop for a multitude of business meetings, providing a unique and often enjoyable setting for important discussions. In popular culture and Hollywood movies, we often witness iconic meetings taking place in restaurants, further solidifying the notion that these venues offer an intriguing mix of formality and comfort.

In cinematic depictions, restaurants have been the stage for pivotal moments in business. Think of the classic scene from "The Godfather," where Michael Corleone makes life-changing decisions while dining in an Italian restaurant. In "Wall Street," Gordon Gekko meets with Bud Fox over lunch, delivering the iconic line, "Greed is good." These examples highlight the enduring allure of conducting business over a meal.

The typical flow of these restaurant meetings follows a well-established pattern. First, there's the act of ordering, which often involves some deliberation over the menu and perhaps even a suggestion or recommendation from the server. This initial step sets the tone for the gathering, allowing participants to engage in a relaxed yet purposeful manner.

Once the food arrives, the discussion takes a natural turn towards its quality and taste. Participants share their impressions, likes, and dislikes, fostering a sense of camaraderie and connection. This aspect of the meeting transcends the formal agenda, allowing individuals to relate on a more personal level.

Small talk is another integral element of restaurant meetings. Beyond the core agenda, participants engage in casual conversation, often discussing topics unrelated to business. This informal banter contributes to the relaxed ambiance, making the meeting feel less transactional and more human.

Comparing this to a video conferencing meeting, the differences become stark. In a virtual setting, ordering and sharing a meal are eliminated, leaving only the core conversation. Without the sensory experience of food and the informal ambiance of a restaurant, video conferencing meetings can feel more sterile and devoid of the personal touch that restaurant meetings offer. The absence of physical cues and the limitations of screen interactions often make it challenging to establish the same level of rapport and camaraderie.

#### Work + Play

Golf courses have consistently served as a favored venue for a wide array of business meetings. This choice is grounded in the appeal of combining a leisurely activity with productive discussions, offering a unique and engaging setting for important conversations.

One key reason for the popularity of golf course meetings is the inherent human tendency to enjoy conversing while engaging in a light and enjoyable activity. Golf, with its scenic and tranquil surroundings, provides an ideal backdrop for such interactions. The Wolf of Wall Street includes a scene where Jordan Belfort conducts a crucial business negotiation on a golf course.&#x20;

The typical flow of business meetings on golf courses follows a distinct pattern. Participants start with the game itself, which provides a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere. As they progress through the course, the natural rhythm of play allows for intermittent conversations about the game and various other topics. These discussions often extend beyond the immediate business agenda, fostering camaraderie and relationship-building.

One notable feature of golf course meetings is the balance between minutes of play and long conversations as participants walk from one hole to the next. These transitions offer ideal opportunities for discussions that enhance both personal connections and the core agenda of the meeting.

Comparing this to a video conferencing meeting, the distinctions are evident. Video conferencing lacks the physicality of the game and the serene outdoor environment that golf courses provide. Virtual meetings primarily focus on the core conversation, often omitting the informal and interpersonal aspects that make golf course meetings distinctive. Without the physical context and social cues, video conferencing meetings may feel more transactional and less conducive to fostering strong connections among participants.

## The Ski Slope Theory

The Ski Slope Theory is rooted in the idea that the setting and structure of a meeting influence the depth and quality of discussions. It draws inspiration from activities like skiing, where participants experience moments of camaraderie while riding the ski lift, and moments of excitement and competition during their descent. These activities offer opportunities for both casual conversations and intense engagement.

Adapting the Theory to Virtual Meetings:

In the virtual realm, the absence of physical settings and activities can lead to sterile and unengaging meetings. However, The Ski Slope Theory offers a philosophical framework to transform virtual meetings into dynamic and interactive experiences.

## Interactive Meetings - A submission

1. Virtual Ski Slopes:

Imagine a virtual meeting room designed like a ski slope, complete with a digital ski lift and a thrilling descent. Participants can "ride" the lift, engage in conversations, and share thoughts, similar to the way they would while physically ascending a mountain. The descent, although virtual, becomes a catalyst for discussions that go beyond the immediate business agenda.

2. Varied Slope Duration:

To adapt to different meeting requirements, virtual slopes can vary in duration. Shorter slopes may be suitable for brief updates, while longer ones can accommodate in-depth discussions. This flexibility allows meetings to be tailored to the specific needs of the participants.

3. Friendly Competition:

Incorporating elements of friendly competition, such as comparing scores or achievements, can add excitement to virtual meetings. Participants can compete virtually while continuing discussions, fostering a sense of shared purpose and engagement.

## Conclusion

The Ski Slope Theory, when applied to virtual meetings, provides a philosophical foundation for enhancing the quality of online interactions. By recreating the human dimension and infusing elements of excitement and engagement, we can transform virtual meetings into more meaningful and enjoyable experiences. As we continue to navigate the digital landscape, understanding and implementing such theories can pave the way for a future where virtual meetings are not just efficient but also deeply human.
